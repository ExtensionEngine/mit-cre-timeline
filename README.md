XBlock for Panama case study

TODO:
* move images to edX and do not load from Jeff's prototype website
* fix fonts
* enable video play (it is disabled while developing because it sucks life out of machine)
* fix minor CSS issues like link visited and link hover overrides from edX
* add tracking event when the student has scrolled to the bottom

FUTURE PLANS:
create a form to create this XBlock dynamically
