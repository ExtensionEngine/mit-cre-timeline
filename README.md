XBlock for Panama case study

TODO:
* enable video play (it is disabled while developing because it sucks life out of machine)
* add tracking event when the student has scrolled to the bottom
* video should be loaded from the XBlock as well

FUTURE PLANS:
create a form to create this XBlock dynamically
